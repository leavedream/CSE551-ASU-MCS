That is, operation i costs f(i), where f(i) = i, if i = 2^(k) for some k ≥ 0, and f(i) = 1 otherwise. Determine the amortized cost per operation using the following methods of analysis:\n",

    "Suppose that we have a stack S that supports the following operations: Push (S,x), which pushes an element x on top of the stack S, Pop (S), which removes the element at the top of stack S, and MultiPop (S,k), which removes the top k elements from the stack S (if we try to remove more elements than the current number of elements on the stack in a Pop or MultiPop operation, only the elements currently on the stack will be returned). Assume that the stack is initially empty. Give a potential function argument showing that the amortized running time of each of the three stack operations is Θ(1)."
